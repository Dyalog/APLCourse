# APL Course
A self-study introduction to Dyalog APL with exercises.

This course consists of a series of short instructional notes interleaved with problem sets. The first few sessions are accompanied by video tutorials.

## Status
The course is undergoing changes in structure and content. We do not currently recommend linking to specific pages or sections at the current time, as those links are likely to break in future updates.

## Getting Started
If you're just starting out, you can use the [TryAPL](https://tryapl.org) online interpreter. Put TryAPL on one half of your screen, and [view the course](https://course.dyalog.com) on the other half. 

If you need help typing APL glyphs (e.g. `×⌿⍳`) then see [the APL Wiki](https://aplwiki.com/wiki/Typing_glyphs).

## Audience
This course assumes high-school / secondary level mathematics knowledge, and some familiarity with basic programming terminology (e.g. *function*, *variable*, *recursion*). It is not currently intended as a general introduction to programming, but more of a fast-track to getting up and running with modern APL. It is expected that most users will learn the basics here and leave the course to further their own learning
