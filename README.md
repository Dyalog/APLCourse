## Getting Started
If you're just starting out, you can use the [TryAPL](https://tryapl.org) online interpreter. Put TryAPL on one half of your screen, and view the course on the other half.

Chapters and exercises involving the use of external files and some [system functions](./Quad%20names.md) require the full Dyalog system, which can be [downloaded for free from the Dyalog website](https://www.dyalog.com/download-zone.htm).

If you need help typing APL glyphs (e.g. `×⌿⍳`) then see [the APL Wiki](https://aplwiki.com/wiki/Typing_glyphs#Prefix_key).

## Audience
This course assumes high-school / secondary level mathematics knowledge, and some familiarity with basic programming terminology (e.g. *function*, *variable*, *recursion*). It is not intended as a general introduction to programming, but more of a fast-track to getting up and running with modern APL.
