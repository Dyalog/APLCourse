# APL Course
A self-study introduction to Dyalog APL with exercises.

This course consists of a series of short instructional notes interleaved with problem sets.

## Status
This site is a work in progress. Currently we are transferring content from [APL Workshop](https://rikedyp.uk/APLWorkshop) while reviewing and updating it.

## Getting Started
If you're just starting out, you can use the [TryAPL](https://tryapl.org) online interpreter. Put TryAPL on one half of your screen, and [view the course](https://course.dyalog.com) on the other half.

You can type APL using a prefix key followed by another key. For example, <kbd>\`a\`p\`l</kbd> gives `⍺*⎕`. The prefix key is backtick (<code>`</code>), at the top-left of most US and UK keyboard layouts.

If you need help typing APL glyphs (e.g. `×⌿⍳`) then see [the APL Wiki](https://aplwiki.com/wiki/Typing_glyphs).
