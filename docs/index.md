# APL Course
A self-study introduction to Dyalog APL with exercises.

This course consists of a series of short instructional notes interleaved with problem sets. The first few sessions are accompanied by video tutorials.

## Status
This site is a work in progress. Currently we are transferring content from [APL Workshop](https://rikedyp.uk/APLWorkshop) while reviewing and updating it.

!!! Note "Rendering of mathematical notation"
	There is a known issue with the MathJax renderer.  
	If you see some text which looks like  
	`\(\sum_{n=1}^N n\)`  
	then try refreshing the page. It should look like:  
	<img alt="mathjax example rendering" src="./img/mathjax.png" width="60px">

## Getting Started
If you're just starting out, you can use the [TryAPL](https://tryapl.org) online interpreter. Put TryAPL on one half of your screen, and this site on the other half. 

If you need help typing APL glyphs (e.g. `×⌿⍳`) then see [the APL Wiki](https://aplwiki.com/wiki/Typing_glyphs).

## Audience
This course assumes high-school / secondary level mathematics knowledge, and some familiarity with basic programming terminology (e.g. *function*, *variable*, *recursion*). It is not currently intended as a general introduction to programming, but more of a fast-track to getting up and running with modern APL. It is expected that most users will learn the basics here and leave the course to further their own learning
