# APL Course - Custom Spring 2021
Instructional notes and activities to learn Dyalog APL.

!!! Note "Rendering of mathematical notation"
	There is a known issue with the MathJax renderer.  
	If you see some text which looks like:  
	`\(\sum_{n=1}^N n\)`  
	then try refreshing the page. It should look like:  
	<img alt="mathjax example rendering" src="./img/mathjax.png" width="60px">
