# Basic syntax

## Functions and arguments
APL has two-argument, infix functions. These are called <dfn>dyadic</dfn> functions.

```APL
      3 × 5
```
```
15
```
---
```APL
      3 - 5
```
```
¯2
```

Some functions map between elements of their left and right argument arrays. It is easy to add lists of numbers together:
```APL
      1 2 3 + 4 5 6
```
```
5 7 9
```

Negative numbers are written with a <dfn>high minus</dfn> `¯` to differentiate between negation (`-3`) and literal negative numbers (`¯3`).
```APL
      1 2 3 - 1 0 ¯1
```
```
0 2 4
```

There are also one-argument, prefix functions. These are called <dfn>monadic</dfn> functions.
```APL
      - 5 ¯3 0 ¯4 2
```
```
¯5 3 0 4 ¯2
```
---
```APL
      ⌽ 1 2 3 4 5
```
```
5 4 3 2 1
```

Some symbols represent both a monadic and a dyadic function, but these are often closely related. As we will see later, even user-defined functions can be monadic, dyadic or even both (<dfn>ambivalent</dfn>).

**:bulb: Try this**: Use these functions monadically and dyadically:

<div class="center language-APL" markdown="span">
<div class="displayBox" markdown="span">
<a class="glyph" title="Plus">`+`</a>
<a class="glyph" title="Minus/Negate">`-`</a>
<a class="glyph" title="Times/Sign">`×`</a>
<a class="glyph" title="Divide/Inverse">`÷`</a>
<a class="glyph" title="Residue/Magnitude">`|`</a>
<a class="glyph" title="Power">`*`</a>
<a class="glyph" title="Logarithm">`⍟`</a>
<a class="glyph" title="Max/Ceiling">`⌈`</a>
<a class="glyph" title="Min/Floor">`⌊`</a>
</div>
</div>

## Singleton extension
Dyadic functions can map between a single value and an array of values.
```APL
      3 × 1 10 100
```
```
3 30 300
```
---
```APL
      3 = 1 2 3 4 5
```
```
0 0 1 0 0
```

**:bulb: Try this**: Replace the functions in the previous two expressions with:
<a class="glyph" title="Max">`⌈`</a>
		<a class="glyph" title="Min">`⌊`</a>
		<a class="glyph" title="Less than">`<`</a>

While experimenting, you may cause a `LENGTH ERROR`:

```APL
      1 2+3 4 5
```
```
LENGTH ERROR: Mismatched left and right argument shapes
      1 2+3 4 5
         ∧
```

Functions such as `+ × ⌈` apply between elements of two arrays of the same shape, or between one element and many if one of the arguments is a single value. However, if the arrays are of two different shapes, it is not clear how the function should be applied. Of course, you may want to [apply a function between all combinations of elements of the left and right argument](./array-logic-data-driven-conditionals.md#the-outer-product), but that will be addressed soon enough.

## Order of execution
Expressions are executed from right to left.

```APL
      10×⍳2+5
```
```
10 20 30 40 50 60 70
```

??? Info "Show me step-by-step"
	To start, there is a literal number 5:
	```APL
	            5
	5
	```
	
	Next, there is a plus `+` with a number 2 to its immediate left, so it is evaluated as two plus five:
	```APL
	          2+5
	7
	```
	
	Then the symbol <dfn>iota</dfn> `⍳`. To its left is another function, times `×`, not a value. So the function is called <em>monadically</em>. The monadic form of `⍳` is the <dfn>index generator</dfn>, which generates an integer array of length defined by its right argument.
	```
	         ⍳2+5
	1 2 3 4 5 6 7
	```
	
	Lastly, another dyadic function, we multiply our list by ten:
	```
	      10×⍳2+5
	10 20 30 40 50 60 70
	```

The expression above is "ten *times* the indices from 1 to *two plus five*, or in short: "ten times iota two plus five". We can make it clearer using (superfluous) **parentheses** `()`.
```APL
      10×(⍳(2+5))
```
```
10 20 30 40 50 60 70
```

Of course, we can change the order of execution using different parentheses.

```APL
      (10×⍳2)+5
```
```
15 25
```

??? Info "Show me step-by-step"
	Beginning from the right, there is a literal number 5:
	```APL
	      (10×⍳2)+5
	              5
	```
	
	Then there is a plus symbol `+`. Before we can decide if it is being called monadically or dyadically, we must look to the left.
	
	```APL
	            )+5
	```
	
	A right parenthesis. We must evaluate the contents of the parentheses to see if it is a function or a value.
	
	```APL
	      (10×⍳2)
	```
	
	This expression evaluates to the list `10 20`. Since it is a value, it is used as the left argument to our plus function.
	
	```APL
	      (10×⍳2)+5
	      (10 20)+5
	15 25
	```

Infix (dyadic) functions have a **short** *left* scope and **long** *right* scope. This means that they take the result of everything to their right hand side as their right argument. 

If there is one, the left argument is the value to the <em>immediate</em> left.

However, juxtaposed values form lists <em>before</em> any functions are applied. This is called <dfn>stranding</dfn> and lets us write very natural expressions, such as:

```APL
      1 2 3 + 4 5 6
5 7 9
```

but this can lead to some surprises if we are not aware:

```APL
      2 + 2 2 + 2
```
```
6 6
```

??? Info "Show me step-by-step"
	First, there is a literal number 2
	```APL
	                2
	2
	```
	
	Then there is a symbol `+`. What, if any, is the value to its immediate left?
	```APL
	          2 2 + 2
	```
	
	It is a 2-element vector `2 2`. The plus function maps between these elements and the single number on the right:
	```APL
	          2 2 + 2
	4 4
	```
	
	Finally there is another addition. The overall evaluation looks like the following:
	```APL
	      2 + 2 2 + 2
	      2 + 4 4
	      6 6
	```

## Comments
Anything after a lamp symbol `⍝` is ignored.

```APL
      ⍝ nothing happens on this line
      2 × 3 ⍝ 4 5
```
```
6
```
---
```APL
	  'A'   ⍝ lamp is not an "A"
```
```
A
```

## The reduction operator
Adding a list of numbers *could* become very tedious...
```APL
      1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9+10+11+12+13+14+15
```
```
120
```

The **reduce** [operator](./Operators.md) `F/` inserts the function `F` to its left between parts of the right argument array.
```APL
      +/1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15
```
```
120
```

It is called *reduce* because it reduces the number of dimensions of its argument. In the example above, we have a **vector** (1 dimensional, list) argument and return a **scalar** (0 dimensional, single value) result.

## The index generator
The index generator `⍳⍵` generates integers up to the integer right argument `⍵`
```APL
      ⍳10
```
```
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
```

So we can do an arithmetic sum as follows

|**Traditional Mathematical Notation (TMN)** | **APL** |
|---|---|
| $\sum_{n=1}^N n$ | `+/⍳N`

## What do these errors mean?
While experimenting, you are very likely to come across these:

```APL
      ⍳¯4
```
```
DOMAIN ERROR
      ⍳¯4
      ∧
```

The `DOMAIN ERROR` means that APL cannot compute what you are asking for. In this case, it cannot generate indices up to a negative number. Negative numbers are <em>outside the domain</em> of the index generator function. How might you [generate integers from 1 to negative four](./dfns-and-assignment.md#problem-set-2)?

```APL
      1+
SYNTAX ERROR: Missing right argument
      1+
       ∧
```

A `SYNTAX ERROR` means that the expression which you tried to execute does not make sense. In the case above, it is because functions always either take a single argument to their right or two arguments, one to the right and one to the left. Functions never take a single argument to their left.

```APL
      a
VALUE ERROR: Undefined name: a
      a
      ∧
```

A `VALUE ERROR` means that there is nothing associated with the name provided. We have not seen any named functions or variables yet; nothing has been assigned to the name `a`, so trying to use it in an expression is meaningless.

## Problem Set 1
1.   
	The average daily temperatures, in degrees Celcius, for 7 days are stored in a variable `t_allweek`.
	
	```APL
	t_allweek ← 11.7 8.6 9.7 14.2 6.7 11.8 9.2
	```
	
	Use APL to compute the follwing:
	
	1. The highest daily temperature
	1. The lowest daily temperature
	1. The range of (difference between the largest and the smallest) temperatures
	1. Each temperature rounded to the nearest whole number

		> but this is less efficient because it does more subtractions than it needs to. Recall the right-to-left evaluation:

		      ⌈/      t_allweek                 - 6.7
		      ⌈/ 11.7 8.6 9.7 14.2 6.7 11.8 9.2 - 6.7
		      ⌈/ 5 1.9 3 7.5 0 5.1 2.5
		      7.5
		```
		
		> if we use parentheses `()` to force APL to compute the maximum of the list before doing subtraction, we only do a single subtraction instead of 7:
		```APL
		      ( ⌈/t_allweek ) - ⌊/ t_allweek
		      ( ⌈/t_allweek ) - 6.7
		      (     14.2    ) - 6.7
		      7.5
		```
		
		</li>
		<li>
		To round to the nearest whole number, either add 0.5 and round down:
		```APL
		      ⌊0.5+t_allweek
		12 9 10 14 7 12 9
		```
		
		or subtract 0.5 and round up:
		```APL
		      ⌈t_allweek-0.5
		12 9 10 14 7 12 9
		```
		</li>

1. A Mathematical Notation

	Use APL to evaluate the following

	1. $\prod_{n=1}^{12} n$ (multiply together the first twelve integers)

	1. $\sum_{n=1}^{17}n^2$ (add together the first seventeen squared integers)

	1. $\sum_{n=1}^{100}2n$ (add together the first one hundred positive even integers)

	1. $\sum_{n=1}^{100}2n-1$ (add together the first one hundred odd integers)

	1. In TMN, the following expression is equal to `0`, why does the following return `70` in APL?
		```APL
		      84 - 12 - 1 - 13 - 28 - 9 - 6 - 15  
		```
		```
		70
		```
